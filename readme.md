### The first project for the first course of the MSU Game Design and Development Specialization.

With this project I learned:

- How 3D environments work
- The basics of lighting systems
- Skybox
- The basics of cameras and working with multiple cameras
- The basics of materials
- The basics of sound
- How to create trail renderers
- Tips for organizing the content of a project
- Tips for organizing the content of your project
- How prefabs work

### My personal touch for this project was:

 - Add trail renderers on planetOrbiters prefabs that orbits the sun at the same position of each planet to create the white circle effect that allows the player to know what
   is the path that each planet is following.

 - Coded a script that:
    - Allows the player to move with W, A, S, and D keys
    - Allows the player to rotate the camera when moving the cursor to the desired rotate diretion when inside the rotation area of the screen
    - Moves the minimap camera when the player decides to move
